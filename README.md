# Motivation

Test project for learning clojure.

# Usages

There is no real life usage but might be used for storing some plans if you don't want to share data with some exteranl service.

Before using override sqlite file path in application.toml :

    [database]
    path = "/wryb.db" #if you use this app you have to rewrite this

Run:

    lein run

Ui will be allowed by http://localhost:3000
