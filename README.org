#+title: wryb

* Motivation
Test project to learning clojure.
* Usages
There is no real life usage but might be used for storing some plans if you don't want to share data with exteranl service.

Before using override sqlite file path in application.toml :
#+begin_src toml
[database]
path = "/wryb.db" #if you use this app you have to rewrite this
#+end_src

Run:
#+begin_src bash
lein run
#+end_src
Ui will be allowed by localhost:3000

* TODOs
- [ ] UI for working with categories
  +it might be new form which appiers by double click like what it is with htmlx+
  add category do via some button form like editing
